<h1>Privacy Policy — VCF Generator</h1>
<p>Last updated: 2025-09-05</p>
<p><strong>What we do:</strong> VCF Generator runs locally in your browser/app and creates vCard (.vcf) files for you to download. We do not collect or transmit your contacts or personal data to our servers.</p>
<p><strong>Local storage:</strong> The app stores generated VCF content in your device's browser local storage only (for convenience). It is not uploaded anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Third-party services:</strong> If you enable ads or analytics, we may use third-party services that collect data according to their own policies (list them and link to their privacy pages).</p>
